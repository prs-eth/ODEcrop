## üåå Overview
RNNs are not very happy with irregulary sampled time series since they do not have explicit notion of time by definition.

In remote sensing and Earth observation we often have data gaps which translates irregular time series not only due to clouds, but also caused by irregular acquisition patterns in space or time, sensor failures and replacements, transmission limits, etc. For instance, we show below examples of Sentinel-2 time series data from TUM dataset (left for winter wheat, right for corn). Observations obscured
by clouds are marked in blue at the bottom. Note their irregular distribution.

## Setup
We use a Conda environment that makes it easy to install all dependencies. Our code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with PyTorch xx and CUDA xx.

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) with Python 3.8.
2. Create the conda environment: ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
3. Activate the environment: ```conda activate node```
